Designed and implemented custom NLP algorithms to extract rare, domain-specific words from the dataset,
conducting frequency analysis to enhance the understanding of underrepresented linguistic elements. By
developing techniques for contextual sentence creation using advanced language models like transformers,
ensured syntactically correct and contextually relevant sentence generation. This enriched the original dataset
with newly generated sentences, expanding its linguistic diversity and utility.
